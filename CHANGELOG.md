New features
-

New function `updateRoot` to force rendering of some root and optinally update its factory. `addRoot` does not wait for next frame anymore, but shows it in same frame. Root factory also gets its `IBobrilRoot` as first parameter. 

5.0.4

5.0.1

Fixes
-

5.0.0
--

BREAKING CHANGE
-

Method `convertPointFromPageToNode` was renamed to `convertPointFromClientToNode` - it did correct transformation but it was needed to correct by window scroll. Now you need just pass x,y from mouse event (which always where in Client coordinates) and it will be converted correctly in all cases.
This method was used rarely and even in example it was used wrongly. So I don't expect breaking existing apps, or complex fixing.

4.49.2

Workaround for IE10 pointer events not triggering over body/html without focus.

4.40.0
--

New Features
-

New component function `postUpdateDomEverytime` which if exists is called in every frame regardless shouldUpdate or local invalidate.
When both function `postUpdateDom` and `postUpdateDomEverytime` exists then they are called in this order. In all cases from children to parent order (nothing changed).
Use case for this function could be updating layout even-though parent prevented child update with returning `false` from `shouldUpdate`.
